Start
1. Create an array of named vehicles:
   a. Populate it with 5 different cars.
2. Use a For loop to output (Use print not (console.log) this is used in JavaScript):
   a. Print each car within the vehicles array after the string “I would love to drive a ……” .
3. Output should read as:
   a. “ I would love to drive a [nameOfCar] ”
   b. Repeated 5 times, once for each car in the array.
