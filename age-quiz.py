Task 3.1 Control Structures file age-quiz.py

Start
1. If the user is 40 or over, output the message "You're over the hill."
2. Write code to take in a userâ€™s age and store it in an integer variable called age.
3. Assume that the oldest someone can be is 100; if the user enters a higher number, output the message "Sorry, you're dead.".
4. If the user is 65 or older, output the message "Enjoy your retirement!"
5. If the user is under 13, output the message "You qualify for the kiddie discount."
6. If the user is 21, output the message "Congrats on your 21st!"
7. For any other age, output the message "Age is but a number." 

Logical order to meet:

0 to 12		    # If the user < 13,                 "You qualify for the kiddie discount."
13 to 39	    # For any other age,                "Age is but a number." NOT INCLUDING 21
21 ONLY	        # If the user == 21,                "Congrats on your 21st!"
40 to 64	    # If user is >= 40,                 "You're over the hill."
65 to 100	    # If the user is >= 65,             "Enjoy your retirement!"
100 to infinity	# Oldest someone can be is > 100,   "Sorry, you're dead."
