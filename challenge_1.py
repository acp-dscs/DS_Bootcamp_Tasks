Task 2.1.Challenge file challenge_1.py

Start
1. Import math module to allow for more advance maths. In this case square root.
2. Request the user to enter the lengths of all three sides of a triangle.
3. Calculate the area of the triangle.
4. Print out the area of the triangle.
End

# import math to use 'math.sqrt' or can also use 'from math import sqrt' then just put 'sqrt' before brackets. Could also not import math and end brackets with **0.5 to square root.
