Task 20.1 Natural Language Processing - Semantic Similarity (semantic.py)
This program compares words and sentences using the pre-trained word vectors used by SpaCy's 'en_core_web_md' model.

Start
1. Run all the code extracts provided in the task file.
2. Write a note on what you noticed about the similarities between:
   a. cat
   b. monkey
   c. banana
   d. Think of an example of your own
3. Run the example file on:
   a. With the simpler language model ‘en_core_web_sm’.
   b. Write a note on what you notice may be different from the model 'en_core_web_md'
End

Task 20.2 Natural Language Processing - Semantic Similarity (movies.ipynb)
The goal of this notebook is to build a system that will tell you what to watch next based on the word vector similarity of the description of movies.
This program compares movie description sentences using the pre-trained word vectors used by SpaCy's 'en_core_web_md' model.

Start
1. Build a system that will tell you what to watch next based on the word vector similarity of the description of movies.
2. Read in the movies.txt file.
   a. Each separate line is a description of a different movie.
3. Create a function:
   a. Returning which movies a user would watch next if they have watched Planet Hulk with the description:
      “Will he save their world or destroy it? When the Hulk becomes too dangerous for the Earth,
      the Illuminati trick Hulk into a shuttle and launch him into space to a planet where the Hulk can live in peace.
      Unfortunately, Hulk lands on the planet Sakaar where he is sold into slavery and trained as a gladiator.”
4. The function should take in the description:
   a. As a parameter
   b. Return the title of the most similar movie
End
